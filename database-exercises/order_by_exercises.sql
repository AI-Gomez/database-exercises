###Modify your first query to order by first name. The first result should be Irena Reutenauer and the last result should be Vidya Simmen
select *
from employees
where first_name in ('Irena', 'Vidya', 'Maya')
order by first_name;

###Update the query to order by first name and then last name. The first result should now be Irena Acton and the last should be Vidya Zweizig
select *
from employees
where first_name in ('Irena', 'Vidya', 'Maya')
order by first_name, last_name;

###Change the order by clause so that you order by last name before first name. Your first result should still be Irena Acton but now the last result should be Maya Zyda
select *
from employees
where first_name in ('Irena', 'Vidya', 'Maya')
order by last_name, first_name;

###Update your queries for employees with 'E' in their last name to sort the results by their employee number. Your results should not change
select last_name
from employees 
where last_name like 'E%'
order by emp_no;


###Now reverse the sort order for both queries.
select last_name
from employees 
where last_name like 'E%'
order by emp_no desc;
